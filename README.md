This is a parser and address normalizer for the builk data from [OpenStates](http://openstates.org/downloads/)

A large portion of this code is devoted to taking unstructred address strings and turning them into
structured data with the help of [TIGER](http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html) and [http://federalgovernmentzipcodes.us/](http://federalgovernmentzipcodes.us/)
